# Online-Job-Posting-Mining

## Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/madhab/jobposts/downloads/online-job-postings.zip/1

Using SPSS modeler and the Armenian human resource portal "CareerCenter" dataset of online job postings, I will elaborate different models that will provide us with insights on different aspects of the employement market between 2004 and 2015.

## More particularily we are looking to:

  1- Understand the demand for particular jobs.
  
  2- Detect major industries in order to help universities and higher education institutions to build/modify their curriculums.
  
  3- Identify skills that are most required by employers.
  
  4- Provide recommendations for job seekers and employers. 
  
 As an interesting we can build a chatbot that would incorporate this tool, to make it even intuitive for employers and job seekers.

This is a resume of obtained results, illustrating the requirements of different job fields:

### The percentage indicates how much the requirement is needed within the given job field!
